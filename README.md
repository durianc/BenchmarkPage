# HelmetDetectionPage

 This is a **single-page** application designed to provide a seamless user experience for both **downloading the dataset and evaluating helmet detection models**. It includes the following features:
### Dataset Download:
The HWD2024 dataset is a vital resource for developing and evaluating helmet-wearing detection systems.  
Once the paper is accepted, the dataset will be available to download.

### Online Model Evaluation:
1. Upload Prediction Results:
  - Click the 'Upload JSON file' button to upload a JSON file containing your model's prediction results.
  - A demo JSON file is available here to illustrate the required data format for prediction results.

2. Email Verification:

  * Email verification is required to confirm your identity.
  * Ensure you use an educational email address for verification.
3. Evaluate & Show Results:

  * After uploading your JSON file, click on the "Evaluate & Show Results" button to obtain the evaluation results.
  * The system will calculate the model accuracy, including Average Precision (AP) per class and mean Average Precision (mAP).
  * You can save the evaluation results in JSON or XLSX format to your local system.

4. Outstanding Results:
  * This following table displays the evaluation results of state-of-the-art models. The results of the model proposed in this study, along with model weights and code, are already shown in the table.
  * If your model results are exceptional, you can choose to add them to the public leaderboard for comparison with other models.
